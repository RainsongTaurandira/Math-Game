# Math Game
 JavaScript Arithmatic Flash Card Game, based on a tutorial

What is it?
This game is a selection of basic arithmatic flash-cards, with four possible answers for each question. Click on the correct answer. The idea is to answer as many as possible in two minutes. You gain one point per question answered. Wrong answers don't lose points, it just takes time to guess again.

Where did it come from?
This started out as a walk-through tutorial: the Multiplication section.
The tutorial in question is:

What did I do with it?
Expanded to all four elementary arithmatic functions and add a menu page.

Division was the trickiest. The first attempt increased the difficulty level too far beyond the other three, using pretty much the same approach as those. 
So, I changed the logic to "multiply two numbers between 1 and 12" and divide by one of them. Almost seems too obvious, doesn't it? But that second attempt involved half a dozen variables, and a messy-looking function. 
But it was working.
So, I cleaned up the code, to a more elegant solution.

It was a fun project to play with.


What was used?
Plain 'vanilla' HTML, CSS and JavaScript
